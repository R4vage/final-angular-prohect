# TPFinalProject

Project made for the final challenge of the Angular Trainee Program.
The app consists on an spotify Mock, which uses spotify's endpoints in order to work. Currently it has a functioning Dashboard, My Music Page, User Profile, and pages for most of the individual items, such as artist, album, track or playlist. 
It has been deployed on https://julianm2-makes-great-sites.netlify.app.
